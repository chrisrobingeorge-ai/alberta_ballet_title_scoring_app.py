0. Executive Summary

0.1 What is the Title Scoring App?

The Alberta Ballet Title Scoring App is an internal decision support system that uses machine learning to estimate audience demand for proposed ballet titles. The system is designed to help senior leadership, marketers, and programmers make evidence-based decisions about which titles to select or remount, when and where to run them, and how audience engagement may shift across seasons or regions. The model predicts ticket demand by combining historical ticket sales with economic conditions, public interest signals from platforms like YouTube and Spotify, seasonality patterns, and macroeconomic indicators.

At its core, the app addresses a fundamental challenge faced by ballet companies: the uncertainty inherent in programming future seasons. By analysing patterns in past performance and contextual factors, the system provides quantitative forecasts that can inform artistic and strategic decisions. However, it is crucial to understand that these forecasts represent demand priors rather than deterministic outcomes. They serve as informed starting points for decision-making, not as replacements for artistic judgement or comprehensive business planning.

0.2 Core Capabilities

The app trains a demand forecasting model using the script scripts/trainsafemodel.py, which processes curated historical data through a sophisticated machine learning pipeline. For any proposed title, the model predicts audience interest measured in tickets sold, drawing on multiple information sources. When a title has been performed previously, the model leverages that historical performance data. It also incorporates public buzz signals such as search trends and Wikipedia page views, seasonality and remount metadata to account for timing effects and audience fatigue, and economic climate factors including inflation and consumer confidence measures.

Each prediction generated by the system comes with an explanation. The model uses SHAP values, a technique borrowed from game theory, to show which factors influenced each forecast and by how much. These explanations, combined with feature importance metrics, provide transparency into the model's reasoning. The system exports all of its outputs as model artefacts in formats like .joblib for the trained model itself, .json for metadata and configuration, and .parquet for detailed SHAP values, alongside visualisations and diagnostic plots that support interpretation and validation.

The model demonstrates reasonable forecasting accuracy with a median absolute error of approximately 649 tickets, plus or minus 565 tickets in cross-validation. This means that on average, predictions differ from actual outcomes by about 649 tickets, though this varies depending on the specific production and context. The system achieves an R-squared value of 0.627, indicating that it explains roughly 63% of the variance in ticket sales across different productions.

0.3 Boundaries and Limitations

Understanding what the system does not do is as important as understanding its capabilities. The model predicts ticket volume, not revenue. It does not account for pricing strategies, discount structures, or complimentary ticket policies, all of which significantly affect financial outcomes. The system also does not learn from marketing outcomes or campaign data after a production has run. Whilst it can incorporate pre-existing buzz signals, it cannot assess whether a particular marketing investment would be effective for a given title.

The app does not update dynamically in real time. Retraining the model requires manual invocation of training scripts or implementation of scheduled jobs. Additionally, the system does not optimise scheduling or perform pricing simulations, though the underlying architecture could potentially be extended to support such functionality. Perhaps most importantly, the forecasts should be understood as estimates of demand potential, not as guarantees of actual attendance or financial performance. Numerous factors beyond the model's scope, including execution quality, competitive events, and unforeseen circumstances, influence actual outcomes.

0.4 Model Performance Overview

The model's performance has been rigorously evaluated using time-aware cross-validation, a technique that ensures the model is tested on future data whilst being trained only on past data. This approach mirrors real-world forecasting conditions. The evaluation yields three primary metrics. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 649 tickets, with a standard deviation of 565 tickets, indicates that predictions typically differ from actuals by this amount. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 785 tickets, with a standard deviation of 693 tickets, provides another accuracy measure that penalises larger errors more heavily. The R-squared value of 0.627, with a standard deviation of 0.413, demonstrates that the model explains approximately 63% of the variance in ticket sales, though this explanatory power varies across different validation periods.
