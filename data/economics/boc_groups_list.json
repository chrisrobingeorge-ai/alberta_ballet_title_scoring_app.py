The BLP survey asked businesses, “What do you expect the rate of annual inflation to be in about one, two and five years from now?” BLP estimates use the midpoints of multiple-choice buckets, with values assigned to open-ended buckets (-1% and 9% for the “deflation” and “8% or higher” buckets, respectively).

The BOS 2‑year estimate is based on firms’ responses to the BOS question, “Over the next two years, what do you expect the annual rate of inflation to be, based on the consumer price index?” Firms can select from predetermined ranges and provide a point estimate. In cases where a firm selects a range only: if the range is closed, a midpoint is used; if the range is open‑ended, the average expectation of other firms in that range is used. The BLP survey asked businesses, “What do you expect the rate of annual inflation to be in about one, two and five years from now?” BLP estimates use the midpoints of multiple-choice buckets, with values assigned to open-ended buckets (-1% and 9% for the “deflation” and “8% or higher” buckets, respectively). This question was not asked in the BLP in January or March 2022. January 2023 results are preliminary and range from January 4 to 10, 2023."

The BLP survey asked businesses, “What do you expect the rate of annual inflation to be in about one, two and five years from now?” BLP estimates use the midpoints of multiple-choice buckets, with values assigned to open-ended buckets (-1% and 9% for the “deflation” and “8% or higher” buckets, respectively).

The value for each quarter is the trimmed mean, excluding the two highest and two lowest responses. In the \nBLP, firms can select from predetermined ranges, which can be open or closed.

In the BOS, firms can select from predetermined ranges and also provide a point estimate. In a subset of cases, firms provide a range only, which can be closed or open.

The value for each quarter is the trimmed mean, excluding the two highest and two lowest responses. In the BLP, firms can select from predetermined ranges, which can be open or closed. We use the midpoints of the closed ranges. We assign a value of -1% to responses in the lowest open-ended range (“deflation”) and 9% to responses in the highest open-ended range (“8% or higher”).

Because the historical range of inflation varies widely across CPI components, each inflation rate plotted in the heatmap is standardized by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. This standardization is conducted using data from 1996–2019, except for Regulation-affected services and Other services, where available data begin in 2004 and 2008, respectively. Note that Regulation-affected services includes prices that are affected by government regulations either directly (e.g., child care services) or indirectly (e.g., telephone services).

The colour is white when a component’s inflation rate is close to its average and is a varying shade of red (blue) when the rate is above (below) the average. Because the historical range of inflation varies widely across CPI components, each inflation rate plotted in the heatmap is standardized by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. This standardization is conducted using data from 1996–2019, except for Regulation-affected services and Other services, where available data begin in 2004 and 2008, respectively. Note that Regulation-affected services includes prices that are affected by government regulations either directly (e.g., child care services) or indirectly (e.g., telephone services). Values in parentheses are CPI weights (in percent). Due to rounding, weights within categories may not sum to their respective totals. The components include the temporary GST/HST holiday (December 14, 2024, to February 15, 2025).

The colour is white when a component’s inflation rate is close to its average and is a varying shade of blue (red) when the rate is below (above) the average. Because the historical range of inflation varies widely across CPI components, each inflation rate plotted in the heatmap is standardized by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. This standardization is conducted using data from 1996–2019, except for Regulation-affected services and Other services, where available data begin in 2004 and 2008, respectively. Note that Regulation-affected services includes prices that are affected by government regulations either directly (e.g., child care services) or indirectly (e.g., telephone services). Values in parentheses are CPI weights (in percent). Due to rounding, weights within categories may not sum to their respective totals. The components include the temporary GST/HST holiday (December 14, 2024, to February 15, 2025). This tax change impacts a wide range of goods and services, particularly semi-durable goods and food services.
