Fan Development,Participation vs Spectating,Weak link,Austin Wranglers found youth leagues did not convert to spectators.,Participatory programs do not automatically produce ticket buyers.,Wranglers study,,
Fan Development,Engagement Pathways,Need for deliberate conversion steps,Participation must be tied to spectating intentionally.,Arts schools and community programs must create bridges to mainstage.,Wranglers study,,
Pricing,Dynamics,Dynamic pricing advantage,Revenue +7% in some cases vs static pricing.,Dynamic pricing increases expected revenue under constraints.,Dynamic Pricing paper,,
Pricing,Dynamics,Worst-case risk improvement,Dynamic pricing ~28% better in worst-case revenue (CVaR 5%).,Useful for demand uncertainty and tight capacity.,Dynamic Pricing paper,,
Pricing,Static Pricing,List pricing benefits,Lower admin/menu costs; less brand risk.,May be preferable when demand uncertain but capacity ample.,Dynamic Pricing paper,,
Media,Substitution,TV vs Theatre,"Mixed evidence: sometimes substitute, sometimes complement.",Media strategy must be intentional, not passive.,Handbook Ch.14,
Media,Complementarity,Digital video as engagement,PNB video content increased youth attendance.,Digital-first engagement required for young demographics.,PNB case,,
