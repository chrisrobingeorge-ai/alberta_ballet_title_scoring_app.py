# --- Optional: PyCaret for model validation page ---
# PyCaret is NOT installed by default because:
# 1. It only supports Python 3.9-3.12 (Streamlit Cloud uses 3.13)
# 2. Its dependency pmdarima has build issues on newer Python versions
# 3. The validation feature works fine without it - shows a warning instead
# To enable locally: pip install pycaret>=3.3.0 (requires Python <=3.12)
